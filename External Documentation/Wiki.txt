Project 13 Group 11

Project Description: 

We are developing a Jenkins Plugin that will be able to provide more detailed reports to the console beyond just build failure or build success.

Times:
 
We have tentatively agreed upon having our weekly meetings on Tuesdays at 3:30 - 5:00, with the end time adjusted as needed.

Progress:

For Iteration 1, there is not much to report on.  As of this writing, we have only downloaded the hello world jenkins plugin.  No changes to the file have been made as of yet.
