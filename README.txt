The goal of the project was to output what files were successful,
what files failed, and what files were skipped during a build. We
also wanted an overall shorter output after a build.

Make sure that you are inside the Project13-demo directory before
running the following command:
mvn hpi:run

This should be all you need to do to run our code.

Once you have a build, there should be an option called Refined
Output. This will show you the important information from the build.
