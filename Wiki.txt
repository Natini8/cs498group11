Project 13 Group 11

Minutes:

	March 9, 3:30 - 5:00: We installed the helo world plugin into our repository and created the user stories

	March 25, 7:00 - 8:00: We re-installed the hello world plugin due to an error with the default tests

	March 27, 5:00 - 7:00: Unfortunately, we are still having difficulty actually installing the hello world plugin in such a way that it can run properly. 

Iteration 1:

	There is not much to report on.  As of this writing, we have only downloaded the hello world jenkins plugin.  No changes to the file have been made as of yet.
